Inhale

Friday's asthma review warned me
about blue and brown inhalers.
The nurse told me
they harm the environment,
I nodded in agreement
but was too embarrassed to ask how.
I now have one that's powder based, does what the two did, and has packaging three times the size.
It's very slick.
Opening the cap,
it clicks
and dispenses the medicine.
I can't feel it working,
I'm still coughing.
I would like to be able to breathe easily
without taking the privilege away
from my children's children.
